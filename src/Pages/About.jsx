              This project was conceived as a departure from the typical
              portfolio. <br />
              <br /> My goal was to improve my skills, learn new things and
              humbly contribute something that could be of value to others.{" "}
              <br />I recognize that I have a lot to learn and improve, and I am
              aware that the content of the project can be improved. <br />
              <br />
              The inspiration for this project came from the desire to strike a
              balance between creating a design system and a portfolio, avoiding
              the conventional approach and adding a unique touch to the
              standard format. <br />
              <br />
