# Open-source portfolio

This project represents an effort to subtly merge a portfolio with a design system, avoiding the typical portfolio format and attempting to differentiate myself in a highly competitive industry. 

In order to hone my skills and contribute, I have opted for a minimalist approach, using as few dependencies and libraries as possible. 

The biggest challenge has been organizing the structure and finding a design pattern that aligns with my vision. 

I have prioritized intuition and ease of navigation, recognizing that the project is constantly evolving and open to improvement. 

I am aware of the existence of errors and areas for improvement.
